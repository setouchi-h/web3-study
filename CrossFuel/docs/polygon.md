## Polygon

Including Polygon in our platform is crucial as it has one of the largest user bases among blockchain networks. With Polygon integrated, users can pay gas fees in Polygon for other chains such as zkEVM, making it a convenient payment layer for many users. In fact, having Polygon as a payment gateway can open up opportunities for a vast number of users. That's why we made the decision to include Polygon right from the start, as documented in our thought process for selecting chains which can be found here: https://github.com/taijusanagi/CrossFuel/issues/1.
