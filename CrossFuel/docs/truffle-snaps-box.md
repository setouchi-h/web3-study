## Truffle Snaps Box

We utilized Truffle Snaps Box to create a Metamask boilerplate, which allowed us to start hacking without the need to learn about Metamask Snap. The Metamask unbox process can be found at https://github.com/taijusanagi/CrossFuel/issues/3, which was beneficial as it allowed us to have a rocket start and begin developing Metamask Snap on the first day.

However, we faced a challenge with the use of StyleComponent with React, as this was new technology for us and it took some time to get accustomed to developing on it.
